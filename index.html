            "We become pitiable and ridiculous when we imbibe an unreasoned
            mysticism in our life without any natural or substantial basis.
            People like us, who are proud to be revolutionary in every sense,
            should always be prepared to bear all the difficulties, anxieties,
            pain and suffering which we invite upon ourselves by the struggles
            initiated by us and for which we call ourselves revolutionary."
